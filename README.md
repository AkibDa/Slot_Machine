# Python Slot Machine

This is a simple slot machine game implemented in Python.  It's a project created for educational purposes to practice Python programming concepts.  **This project is not intended to promote or endorse gambling.**

## Description

This Python program simulates a basic slot machine. The user starts with a balance, and can then bet on a certain number of lines and an amount per line. The program then simulates a spin of the reels and calculates the winnings based on the outcome.

## Features

* **Input Validation:**  The program validates user input to ensure it's in the correct format (numbers) and within acceptable ranges (e.g., balance > 0, bet amount > 0).
* **Random Reel Spins:** The `random` module is used to simulate the spinning of the reels, resulting in random symbol combinations.
* **Payout Calculation:**  The program calculates winnings based on predefined payout rules for different symbol combinations and the number of lines bet.
* **Balance Tracking:** The user's balance is tracked throughout the game, and the game ends when the balance reaches zero.
* **Clear Output:** The results of each spin are clearly displayed to the user, including the symbols landed, winnings, and updated balance.
